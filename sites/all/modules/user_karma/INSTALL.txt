User karma - installation
---------------------------

Unpack the module in your "modules" directory.

INSTALLATION:

1. Place the module in the "modules" directory of your drupal installation

3. Enable this module by navigating to:
        Administer > Site building > Modules

3a. Enable the plugin modules. They will add functionality to
    the otherwise useless module :-D The plugins will assign karma for
    specific events (somebody votes on his/her comment, etc.).

4. Configure your module by going to 

    Administer > Site configuration > User Karma

   The options should be self-explanatory.
   SUPER-WARNING: don't let this module add/delete roles other than the ones
   you have created SPECIFICALLY for this module.


5. Enjoy!
