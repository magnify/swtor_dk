README for og_mandatory_group.module:

Compatible with Drupal 6.x. Requires the Organic Groups module.

An add-on for the Organic Groups module that makes one group mandatory for
all new users.

Choose one group that all new users will be put into. You can chose either
an open or a closed group. Any new user will be auto-approved as member of
the group.  The group manager(s) of groups that a new user joins will get
an automatic e-mail notice.

This module also  allows the admin to require a new user to join at 
least one group during registration by requiring them to choose one of 
the groups listed in the registration form. This group is in addition to
any mandatory group.  This feature is disabled by defualt, is independent 
of whether a mandatory group is selected, and has no effect if there are 
no groups listed in the registration form.
