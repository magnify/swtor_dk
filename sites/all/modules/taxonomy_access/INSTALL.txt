TO INSTALL, simply install and enable the module, in these steps.

PLEASE CHECK that you use the right version of Taxonomy Access for your 
  version of DRUPAL.

IMPORTANT: This is a complicated module. When you first learn to use this 
  module, ALWAYS TRY IT FIRST ON A TEST SITE.

NOTE: If you want to USE TWO OR MORE "ACCESS" MODULES AT THE SAME TIME, TEST 
  THEM CAREFULLY. (e.g: OG, node_privacy_by_role, taxonomy access, etc.)

TO UPDATE from previous versions of taxonomy_access: PLEASE READ UPDATE.TXT!
  WHEN UPDATING, ALWAYS disable the module first before uploading the new 
  module, on the page:
  "Administer >> Site building >> Modules"
  (Drupal path: admin/build/modules).


-----------------------
INSTALLATION:
-----------------------

1) COPY all files in the taxonomy_access directory to your Drupal 
   installation's module directory.
   (By default: sites/all/modules/taxonomy_access/ in your Drupal directory.)

2) ENABLE THE MODULE on page: 
   "Administer >> Site building >> Modules"
   (Drupal path: admin/build/modules).

3) REBUILD YOUR NODE ACCESS PERMISSIONS on page:
   "Administer >> Content Management >> Post Settings".
   (Drupal path: admin/content/post-settings/rebuild).

4) GRANT ADMINISTRATORS CONTROL of Taxonomy Access on page:
   "Administer >> User Management >> Permissions"
   (Drupal path: admin/user/permissions).

   To administer Taxonomy Access, administrators must have "access 
   administration pages" checked (under "system module") and "administer 
   permissions" checked (under "user module"). 

5) CONFIGURE ACCESS PERMISSIONS to the various categories at: 
   "Administer >> User Management >> Taxonomy Access Permissions"
   (Drupal path: admin/user/taxonomy_access).

   Be sure to configure your authenticated user permissions, as all custom 
   roles also have the authenticated user role.

NOTE: DATABASE TABLES are automatically added to database. Module creates two 
   database tables: 'term_access' and 'term_access_defaults'.
