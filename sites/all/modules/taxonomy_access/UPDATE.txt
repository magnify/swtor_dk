READ THIS FILE if you are updating from previous versions of 
  'taxonomy_access.module'.

If you are installing taxonomy_access.module for the first time, you may ignore
  this file.

Taxonomy Access uses Drupal's AUTOMATED UPDATE SYSTEM (since Drupal 4.7).

--------
UPDATING
--------

1. DISABLE THE MODULE on page: 
   "Administer >> Site building >> Modules"
   (Drupal path: admin/build/modules).

2. BACKUP your database.

3. UPLOAD the new module files.

4. LOG ON AS MAIN ADMINISTRATOR (user with user ID 1).

5. ENABLE THE MODULE on page: 
   "Administer >> Site building >> Modules"
   (Drupal path: admin/build/modules).

6. RUN UPDATE.PHP by visiting "http://www.example.com/update.php"

7. GRANT ADMINISTRATORS CONTROL on page:
   "Administer >> User Management >> Permissions"
   (Drupal path: admin/user/permissions)

   To administer Taxonomy Access, administrators must have "access 
   administration pages" checked (under "system module") and "administer 
   permissions" checked (under "user module"). 

8. TEST YOUR SITE'S PERMISSIONS.  If there are problems, see the README.txt.

-----------------------
UPDATING FROM VERSION 5.1 OR PREVIOUS
-----------------------

If one upgrades an existing site using an older version (5.1 or before) of 
TAC, then no performance gains will be made until the admin goes through each 
role and "rebuilds" the permissions settings for each role from scratch (i.e. 
disable TAC for that role, then set it up again with just the categories and 
terms to apply TAC settings to).


-----------------------
TAXONOMY ACCESS UPDATES
-----------------------

Update #1: Updating the tables to UTF-8
Update #2: Adding new field 'grant_list' to the tables.
           (Neccessary after revision 1.53 Jan 12, 2006)
Update #3: Changing weight of the  module: put taxonomy_access to the bottom 
           (but before the very last ones) in the chain.
Update #4: Deleting old variable 'taxonomy_access_enabled'
