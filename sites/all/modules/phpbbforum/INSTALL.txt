Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your phpBB forum should be installed in subdirectory of Drupal installation directory 
in order to run inside Drupal page. 
For example, it is /phpBB3. But you may use your own name, but not /phpbbforum.

I. Download the phpBBforum module from http://drupal.org/project/phpbbforum
   
   Unpack the archive.
   The unpacked archive contains directories and files as shown in the left side of the table below.

   Module -------------------------> Your site paths

                                     (Drupal base path: /home/vb/www/example.com/public_html)
+/phpbbforum ----------------------> +/sites/all/modules/phpbbforum
                                     (phpBB root path: /home/vb/www/example.com/public_html/phpBB3/)
  +/includes                         (Path to phpBB api file: sites/all/modules/phpbbforum/includes/)  
    +/phpbbvbridge
    phpbb_api.php                     phpBB api file name: phpbb_api.php
 
  +/contrib
    +/phpbbdrupal                    (Drupal base path: /home/vb/www/example.com/public_html)
      +/images -------------------> +/images
      +/root ---------------------> +(phpBB root path: /home/vb/www/example.com/public_html/phpBB3/)
        phpBB-embed-3.0.6.patch -----------------> +/phpBB3/phpBB-embed-3.0.6.patch
      +/includes -----------------> +/includes
          functions_user.php ----------> functions_user.php (replace or patch)
        +/styles -------------------> +/styles
          +/prosilver-embed ----------> +/prosilver-embed
          +/subsilver2-embed ---------> +/subsilver2-embed

II.  Copy phpbbforum and phpBB directories and files
          
  1) Copy phpbbforum directory to your modules directory.
  
     sites/all/modules/phpbbforum
  
     You do not need to copy .../phpbbforum/contrib subdirectory.

  2) Copy content of .../phpbbforum/contrib/phpbbdrupal/styles subdirectory to your /phpBB3/styles subdirectory

  3) Copy .../phpbbforum/contrib/phpbbdrupal/images directory to Drupal directory.

     If you do not want it, you will have to edit phpBB file editor.js for your phpBB theme
     (/phpBB3/styles/prosilver-embed/template/editor.js) and enter the url, 
     where the file spacer.gif resides.
     
     (function colorPalette(dir, width, height) line 335)
     
     The relative path img src="/images/spacer.gif" provides access to spacer.gif both in standalone an inside Drupal mode 
     only if you copy /images directory to Drupal directory.
     
     Do not forget to add a line 
     
     Disallow: /images/
     
     to your robots.txt file.

III. Apply patch to phpBB

    The patch is made from clean phpBB3-3.0.6.
    
    If you do not want to use embedded mode, you may simple
    copy .../phpbbforum/contrib/phpbbdrupal/includes/functions_user.php to your /phpBB3/includes/functions_user.php
    
    If you do not want to use embedded mode and you are upgrading from previous 1.0 version of the module, restore original functions_user.php.
    The new patch contains these changes.
    
    All changes made by the patch do not affect the standalone behavior of phpBB3.

    Go to phpBB directory.

      cd ./phpBB3

    If you are upgrading from previous version of the module, you may restore the original 
    phpBB source files from previous patch.

      patch -p0 -R < phpBB-embed-3.0.5.patch    
      
    Patch phpBB. Choose appropriate filename for your version of phpBB.

      patch -p0 < phpBB-embed-3.0.6.patch
      
    See http://drupal.org/patch/apply for details or if something is wrong.  

IV. Install and setup phpbbforum module        

  1) To test how you will be authenticated, login to your phpBB forum as admin.

  2) Install phpbbforum module as usual.
     Open new window in browser with your Drupal site, login as admin,
     navigate to Administer >> modules and enable the phpBBforum and profile module.
  
  3) Run update.php if you are upgrading from previous version of the module.
     See http://drupal.org/upgrade/running-update-php for details.  

  4) Go to Administer >> Site configuration >> phpBBforum settings.
  
     Navigate to phpBBforum settings and enter the path to
     phpBB root (path to forum's config.php file).
     (phpBB root path: /home/vb/www/example.com/public_html/phpBB3/)
     
     Save settings and ensure that phpBBforum successfully connected
     to the phpBB database and you are authenticated.

     Your path settings should look like this
     
     phpBB forum root path:
     /home/vb/www/example.com/public_html/phpBB3/ 
     Path to forum directory. Enter the full directory path where phpBB is installed.

     Path to phpBB api file:
     sites/all/modules/phpbbforum/includes/
     Enter the full directory path where phpBB api file is located.

     phpBB api file name:
     phpbb_api.php
     Enter phpBB api file name.

  5) In order to run phpBB inside of drupal page select appropriate mode:
     (To run correctly clean URLs must be enabled.) 
   
     phpBB display way:
     In the window
     In frame inside Drupal page
   X In the Drupal page
  
     Set other settings and Save configuration.
            
  6) Ensure that corresponding profile.module fields exist.
     If necessary create profile.module fields that match with
     phpBB profile fields.

  7) Navigate to Blocks.
     Enable phpBBforum: Hidden authentication block.
     Configure its visibility settings

     Show block on specific pages:
     * Show on every page except the listed pages.
     Pages:
     user/reset/*
     user/password
 
     Do not disable it in the future if you want advanced synchronization.
     Enable the phpBBforum blocks you want to use (optional).
   
  8) Setup link to phpbbforum page.

    1. Try link http://example.com/phpbbforum

    2. If page phpbbforum is not found, Go to Administer >> Site configuration > Performance
  
    Clear cached data
    
    3. Go to Administer >> Site building > Menus > Navigation
    See Menu item with blank title in state (Disabled)
    You may enable it if you do not want phpbbforum in Primary links

    If you enable it your forum page will be with title.
    Reset will help to remove the page title if you disable it back.

    4. Go to Administer >> Site building >> Menus >> Primary links
    Enter Menu item phpbbforum.

    Main page and link to phpBB in page is

    phpbbforum

    To change this name you may add URL aliases.
    
    Add next URL aliases (System path -> URL Alias)
    
    For the path 'forums'
    
    phpbbforum -> forums
    phpbbforum/index.php -> forums/index.php
    phpbbforum/viewtopic.php -> forums/viewtopic.php
    phpbbforum/viewforum.php -> forums/viewforum.php
    phpbbforum/viewonline.php -> forums/viewonline.php
    phpbbforum/memberlist.php -> forums/memberlist.php  
    phpbbforum/posting.php -> forums/posting.php
    phpbbforum/search.php -> forums/search.php
    phpbbforum/ucp.php -> forums/ucp.php
    phpbbforum/mcp.php -> forums/mcp.php
    phpbbforum/faq.php -> forums/faq.php
    phpbbforum/report.php -> forums/report.php
    phpbbforum/adm/index.php -> forums/adm/index.php
    
    Administer >> Site building >> URL aliases >> Add alias
    
    Existing system path: http://example.com/phpbbforum
    
    Specify the existing path you wish to alias. For example: node/28, forum/1, taxonomy/term/1+2.

    http://example.com/forums

    Specify an alternative path by which this data can be accessed. 
    For example, type "about" when writing an about page. 
    Use a relative path and don't add a trailing slash or the URL alias won't work.
    
    All links from blocks will have that path 'forums' instead of system phpbbforum.
    
    It works with or without Clean URLs enabled.
  
  9) To setup content submission to phpBB forum

    1. Go to Content types > Edit your content type
      
      Set in section phpBBforum submission settings
      
      Drupal to phpBB submission:
      ( ) Disabled
      (*) Enabled
      
      Drupal to phpBB submission:
      ( ) Disabled
      (*) Enabled
        
    2. To enable phpBB comments in the node, set Display below the post in the setting:
      
      Location of phpBB topic comments:
      ( ) Display only on the phpBBforum page
      (*) Display below the post
        
      If you want to display both Drupal and phpBB comments, you should change the setting:
      
      Display Drupal comments:
      (*) Display only phpBB comments
      ( ) Display both Drupal and phpBB comments

    3. To display the phpBB topic comments in the node,
      you should insert in your theme in node-your_content_type.tpl.php these lines
    
      <?php if ($phpbbforum_comments): ?>
        <div id="phpbbforum-node-comments"><?php print $phpbbforum_comments; ?></div>
      <?php endif; ?>
      
      For the Garland theme you can use the example file garland.node-story.tpl.php.
      Rename it to node-story.tpl.php and copy to the themes/garland directory.
  
V. Setup phpBB forum
  
  Pay attention to phpBB Settings:
  
  1) Go to phpBB Administration Control Panel > General > Server URL settings

    Server URL settings
    Domain name:
    The domain name this board runs from (for example: www.example.com).
     
    In drupal settings.php variable $base_url and Domain name must be both with or without www.
    
    Domain name: www.example.com
    $base_url = 'http://www.example.com';
    or
    Domain name: example.com
    $base_url = 'http://example.com';
    
    Script path: /phpBB3
    The path where phpBB is located relative to the domain
    name, e.g. /phpBB3.
    If you have drupal and phpBB3 installed in subdirectory you must enter

    Script path: /subdirectory/phpBB3

    Force server URL settings.
    
    Force server URL settings: (*) Yes  () No.
   
  2) Cookie settings.

    Cookie domain: .example.com
    Cookie name: [random name]
    Cookie path: /

    Note: your domain name .example.com with leading dot.
   
  3) User registration settings.

    Account activation:       () Disable (*) None () By User () By Admin
    
    Choose () None or () By User
    If you set By User, user must to login first to phpBB and after that you will see that he is registered.
    Set to None for test purposes.

    Username length:
    Minimum and maximum number of characters in usernames.   [1]    [30]

    Password length:
    Minimum and maximum number of characters in passwords.   [5]    [30]

  4) Security settings.

    Check IP against DNS Blackhole List: () Yes (*) No

    You may switch off
    Check e-mail domain for valid MX record: () Yes (*) No
    If enabled, the e-mail domain provided on registration and profile changes is checked for a valid MX record.

  5) Go to phpBB Administration Control Panel > General > Load settings

    Session length: 86400
    Sessions will expire after this time, in seconds. 
    Set this value according your needs.

  6)  Go to phpBB Administration Control Panel > Styles and install needed embed styles

    prosilver-embed
    Copyright: (C) phpBB Group, 2007 	Install
    or/and
    subsilver2-embed
    Copyright: (C) 2005 phpBB Group 	Install

    In the Install style make sure that the style is active. Do not make it default. Save.

  You should revise all settings that may affect the behavior of the module.

VI. Theming  
  
  You should realize that on phpbbforum page there will be css conflicts 
  between Drupal and phpBB css files.
  The module is not responsible for that. You will have to resolve them yourself.
  
  For the theming of the phpbbforum page the module provides:

  1) two starter phpBB styles:
  
    prosilver-embed
    subsilver2-embed
    
  2) file phpbbforum.css
  
  3) default starter css files for your drupal theme for phpBB styles:
  
    garland-phpbbforum-prosilver.css
    garland-phpbbforum-subsilver2.css
    
    phpbbforum-prosilver.css
    phpbbforum-subsilver2.css
    
    You can copy this files in each used drupal theme directory and customize them individually for this theme.
    In this case these default css files is not used.  
    
  4) file phpbbforum.theme.custom-sample.inc and two functions in it
  
    phpbbforum_set_style_example_embed
    phpbbforum_style_example_embed
    
    If you use your own phpBB style then:
    
    a) rename phpbbforum.theme.custom-sample.inc to phpbbforum.theme.custom.inc

    b) Replace 'example' with the name of your phpBB theme
    
    c) uncomment the suggested lines according your theme origin (prosilver or subsilver2)
    or write your own code.
  
    If you do not provide these function the module analyzes style name.
    If your phpBB style is created from prosilver and its name contains string "prosilver" 
    or starts with "pro" the module treats this style as prosilver.
    In other cases the module treats this style as subsilver2.
    In these cases you do not need to create and edit these functions.
    
  The styles prosilver-embed and subsilver2-embed are used only running phpBB inside Drupal page.
  The phpBB administrators or phpBB users should select only original styles prosilver or subsilver2.
  If you have your own custom style example, you should provide the style example-embed (or example_embed) 
  and it should be active in order to run inside Drupal.
  

VII. Miscellaneous
  
Need to set manually define('PHPBB_SEO_TOOLKIT', 1); in phpbb_api.php if you use this modification of phpBB3.
You may set db persistent connection in phpbb_api.php define('PHPBB_DB_PCONNECT', false); default is true.  

VIII. Hints  
  
Do not think that the embedded inside Drupal phpBB will work for your themes right out of the box.
Install first locally and ensure that with your settings it works as you expect.
Setting up the module for the first time use Garland in Drupal and prosilver or subsilver2 in phpBB themes 
instead of your custom themes.
Do not use exotic layout you will never use on the production site just to test the module.
Do not use domain name with localhost http://localhost.example.com.
Start learning and testing the module with layout that is similiar to your layout on production site.
